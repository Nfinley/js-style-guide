      Bullet 1: Work to Code
    </h3>
    <p>
      Creativity is the enemy. Adhere to the system of production already in place.
      <br><br>
      Ideas should slowly and carefully be built on top of a preexisting idea. Inventions should be conceived of out of necessity. The fact that you can build something doesn't always mean you should.

      <blockquote>
        Nothing can take the place of persistence. Talent will now, nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not, unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not, the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.
